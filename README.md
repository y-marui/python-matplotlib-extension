A matplotlib extension library that embeds a data-only Figure package in plot images or OLE objects so another Python process or console can safely restore and continue editing the Figure. It also provides axis formatting utilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+

## Setup

~~~sh
uv sync
~~~

## Usage

### Save and Load Figures Safely

Importing `matplotlib_extension` adds one opt-in keyword to Matplotlib's existing API. The visible PDF, PNG, or SVG remains a normal graphic, while a versioned data-only package is embedded for editing.

In this package, "editable" does not mean that the file or OLE object contains an editing UI. It means that another Python process or console can restore the saved plot as a `Figure` and continue editing it with the normal Matplotlib API.

~~~python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib_extension

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])

fig.savefig("figure.mpl.pdf", editable=True)
fig.savefig("figure.mpl.png", editable=True)
fig.savefig("figure.mpl.svg", editable=True)
fig.savefig("figure.ole", editable=True)  # native file is a normal editable PNG

restored = matplotlib_extension.loadfig("figure.mpl.pdf")
restored.axes[0].set_title("Edited in another Python console")
restored.savefig("restored.png")
~~~

PDF, PNG, and SVG outputs remain ordinary graphics that can be placed in applications including PowerPoint. OLE is a passive container for the same canonical package. This project does not provide an in-PowerPoint editor or execute embedded code. Editing always happens in Python after passing the file or extracted OLE object to `loadfig()`.

Editable graphics use the compound suffixes `.mpl.png`, `.mpl.pdf`, and `.mpl.svg` so they are visually distinguishable from ordinary files. The user-facing file saved from PowerPoint is always `figure.mpl.png` on both Windows and macOS. It opens as a normal PNG while carrying the safe canonical payload. `.bin` is an internal PPTX part and `.mplpkg` is the internal canonical serialization; neither is the normal interchange format.

~~~python
from matplotlib_extension import extract_editable_png, loadfig

# Common file saved by the PowerPoint extraction bridge.
fig = loadfig("figure.mpl.png")

# Low-level recovery when a raw OLE/CFB part was obtained manually.
extract_editable_png("oleObject1.bin", "figure.mpl.png")
~~~

The native file embedded in the OLE Package is itself `figure.mpl.png`. On Windows, standard OLE behavior or an extraction-only adapter saves this native PNG. Python does not scan the entire PPTX and guess which object should be restored.

If the generic OLE Package operations cannot save the native file reliably, a Windows extraction/export-only verb or adapter may be added. Such an adapter only copies the embedded editable PNG to a file; it never restores or edits a Figure. All editing remains in Python.

On macOS, the workflow does not depend on Windows OLE activation or verbs. An extraction-only PowerPoint bridge obtains the user-selected OLE shape and a copy of the current PPTX through PowerPoint APIs, resolves its internal OLE object, unwraps the native PNG, and saves `figure.mpl.png`. Python never receives the whole PPTX to guess the target, and the bridge never restores or edits a Figure.

The standalone API also supports atomic overwrite and exclusive creation:

~~~python
from matplotlib_extension import savefig

savefig(fig, "figure.mpl.pdf")
savefig(fig, "new-figure.mpl.pdf", mode="x")
savefig(fig, "figure.mplpkg")  # raw canonical package for diagnostics/advanced use
~~~

### Legacy dill Files

Older `.plt.pdf` files may contain live Python objects serialized with dill or a similar mechanism and can execute arbitrary code when loaded. `loadfig()` always rejects this format; it never attempts either an automatic or confirmation-based compatibility fallback.

If one-way conversion of a trusted historical file is needed, a separately distributed, deprecated migration tool may be provided in the future. The main package will not depend on dill, pickle, or cloudpickle. Immediately before the first deserialization in a process, the migration tool must display an arbitrary-code-execution warning and require one exact confirmation phrase. Non-interactive use is denied by default; automation requires a deliberately explicit flag such as `--allow-arbitrary-code-execution`.

Neither a prompt nor a subprocess makes dill safe. Do not convert an untrusted file. Even for a trusted file, use a disposable environment with networking disabled, read-only input, and write access limited to a dedicated output directory. The tool emits `.mpl.png`, which is then revalidated by the normal safe `loadfig()` path. Implementation is tracked in [issue #35](https://github.com/y-marui/python-matplotlib-extension/issues/35).

The format never restores a serialized Python object. It uses canonical JSON and numeric NumPy arrays, restores only allowlisted Matplotlib types, rejects object dtypes, and verifies package paths, sizes, versions, and SHA-256 digests before constructing a new `Figure`. Legacy object-bearing files are rejected rather than restored.

Current round-trip support covers basic `Figure`, `Axes`, `Line2D`, `Text`, `Legend`, scales, locators, and formatters. Unsupported objects are skipped with `UnsupportedFigureWarning`. Numeric scatter and image data can still be retrieved with `matplotlib_extension.recover_data()`; broader artist coverage is tracked in [issue #31](https://github.com/y-marui/python-matplotlib-extension/issues/31).

See the [format specification](docs/EDITABLE_FORMAT.md) (including its [Security Boundary](docs/EDITABLE_FORMAT.md#security-boundary) section) for the exact trust boundary, and the [security policy](SECURITY.md) for how to report a vulnerability.

### LabelString

Converts shorthand keywords to LaTeX representations for matplotlib labels.

~~~python
from matplotlib_extension.label_string import LabelString

ax.set_xlabel(repr(LabelString("alpha vs para")))
# → "$\alpha$ vs $\parallel$"
~~~

Supported keywords: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, `para`, `perp`

### Adjust Locator

Automatically adjusts major and minor tick locators to fit the data range.

~~~python
from matplotlib_extension.pyplot import adjust_locator

adjust_locator(ax, units=(0.5, 10), subunits=(0.1, 2))
~~~
